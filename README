                         README
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is the official, edited and reviewed documentation for 
the Open Build Service (OBS).

The documentation is currently split into two books:
  * The OBS admin guide
  * The OBS best practices guide

To work on this document you need to install the package "daps".

After editing the document validate your changes via the following 
commands:

 # . DC-obs-reference-guide
 # daps validate

or for the best practices guide:

 # . DC-obs-best-practices
 # daps validate

html documentation can get generated via

 # daps html

If "daps" is not available on your distribution, you can try to create a pdf with dblatex

 # dblatex xml/book-obs-reference-guide.xml

This document gets hosted on github

  https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-docu

So the standard github work-flow with forked repositories and pull requests
can be used to contribute to these books.

The former svn repositories on berlios and svn.opensuse.org are not used anymore
and will removed or write protected soon!
