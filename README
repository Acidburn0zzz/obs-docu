-----------------------------------------------------------

This is the official, edited and reviewed documentation for
the Open Build Service (OBS).

The documentation is currently split into three books:
  * The OBS admin guide
  * The OBS reference guide
  * The OBS best practices guide

To work on this document you need to install the package "daps".

After editing the document validate your changes via the following
commands:

 # . DC-obs-reference-guide
 # daps validate

or for the best practices guide:

 # . DC-obs-best-practices
 # daps validate

or for the admin guide:

 # . DC-obs-admin-guide
 # daps validate

HTML documentation can get generated via

 # daps html

If "daps" is not available on your distribution, you can try to create a pdf with dblatex

 # dblatex xml/book-obs-reference-guide.xml

This document is hosted on github

  https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-docu

So the standard github workflow with forked repositories and pull requests
can be used to contribute to these books.

The former svn repositories on berlios and svn.opensuse.org are not used anymore
and will be removed or made write protected soon!


We follow the SUSE docbook XML style. All files can be reformatted to that
using:

  for i in xml/*.xml; do
    /usr/bin/xmlformat.pl --config /etc/daps/docbook-xmlformat.conf -i "$i"
  done

Please separate reformat commits from content changes.
