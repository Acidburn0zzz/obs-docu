This is the official and edited documentation for the Open Build Service (OBS).

The documentation is currently split into two books:
  * The OBS admin guide
  * The OBS best practices guide

To work on this document you need to install the package "susedoc".

Since this documentation is written in docbook, it should also work
without this package, but we don't have documentation for this yet.
Please provide a patch for this file in case you managed to do it ;)

After editing the document validate your changes via the following 
commands:

 # . ENV-obs-reference-guide
 # make validate

or for the best practices guide:

 # . ENV-obs-best-practices
 # make validate

html documentation can get generated via

 # make html

Please ask on opensuse-buildservice@opensuse.org mailing list to
get write access to this document.
