  <title>Contribute directly to foreign projects</title>
  <para>In case a user does not have commit permissions to a project, he can request
        to get maintainership permissions to this project. This makes sense if the user
        is already known to the project owners and they trust him as a maintainer.

        There is a way to do this via the request system of OBS, but only via osc so far:
        
        <screen><command># osc createrequest -a add_me maintainer PROJECT</command></screen>

  <title>Contribute indirect to foreign projects</title>
  <para>Users who are new to a certain project, either because they are new users at all
        or don't have any deeper knowledge about this certain project don't have direct
        commit permissions. However, they can still create a copy of any package source 
        and ask back to merge their changes. &obs; has support to make this easy.
