  <para>
   Please use the standard github work-flow to work on these books. This means
   fork your own copy of the repository, commit your changes there and create a
   pull request. This can be done at
   <ulink url="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service-documentation">https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service-documentation</ulink>
  </para>

  <para>
   It is even possible to host instance specific content in the official
   subversion repository, it is just a matter to tag them correctly. Special
   parts of this documentation are tagged as <command>&lt;para
   os="opensuse;meego"&gt;</command> for example. In this case the paragraph
   will become only visible when creating the openSUSE or MeeGo book.
