    fork your own copy of the repository, commit your changes there and create
    a pull request. This can be done at <link

   <para> It is even possible to host instance specific content in the official
    subversion repository, it is just a matter to tag them correctly. Special
    parts of this documentation are tagged as <command>&lt;para
     os="opensuse;meego"&gt;</command> for example. In this case the paragraph
    will become only visible when creating the openSUSE or MeeGo book. </para>
