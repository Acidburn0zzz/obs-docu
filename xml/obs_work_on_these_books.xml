   These books are written with docbook and can get generated as html or pdf documentation.

   We ask every experienced OBS user or admin to join to work on these books. Subversion
   commit permissions will be granted after the first submitted patch. It is even
   possible to host instance specific content in the official subversion repository, it is 
   just a matter to tag them correctly. Special parts of this documentation are tagged as
   <command>&lt;para os="opensuse;meego"&gt;</command> for example. In this case the paragraph will
   become only visible when creating the openSUSE or MeeGo book.
