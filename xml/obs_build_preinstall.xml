  <title>Build Preinstall Images</title>
  <para>Preinstall images can optionally be used to install a set of packages in one fast step instead
        via single package installations. Depending on the build host even snapshots with copy-on-write
        support may be used which avoids any IO.</para>
  <para>A preinstall image can be used if it provides a subset of packages which is required for the build
        job. The largest possible image is taken if multiple are usable.</para>
  <para>To use a preinstall image there needs to be a package container inside of the project or in a repository
        used by the build job. This package needs a _preinstallimage file. The syntax of it is spec file like, but 
        just needs a Name: and at least one BuildRequires: line. In addition also #!BuildIgnore: tags may be used
        to ignore packages despite of dependencies. Also usage of %if cases is possible. </para>
  <para>Preinstall image build jobs get always preferred to allow the best effect of them. It is recommended to define
        images for often used standard stacks.
        </para>

  <para>Example _preinstallimage file for a basic preinstall image:
        <screen><command>
Name: base
BuildRequires: bash
#!BuildIgnore: brp-trim-desktopfiles
        </command></screen>
        </para>
