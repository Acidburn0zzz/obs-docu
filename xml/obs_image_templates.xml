 <title>Image templates</title>
 <para id="image_template_introduction_paragraph">
  Image templates are pre-configured image configurations. The
  <ulink url="https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates">image templates page
  </ulink> provides a list of these templates. Users can clone these templates
  and further configure them as they like.

  <title>Structure of image templates</title>
  <para>
   As mentioned image templates are essentially pre-configured
   <ulink url="http://opensuse.github.io/kiwi/">&kiwi;</ulink> image configurations.
   As any &kiwi; configuration they usually contain a tarball containing image
   sources, a config.sh file and the &kiwi; configuration XML file.
  </para>
  <para id="image_template_icon_paragraph">
   In addition you can define an icon for your image templates by adding graphical
   image (for example, PNG, JPG) to your template sources and name it <command>_icon</command>.
   If that file exists, it will be used as icon for your image on the image
   templates page.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    For more information about &kiwi; images, see

  <title>Adding / removing image templates to the official image template page</title>
  <para>
   The image templates page lists templates per project. New templates get added
   by setting the <command>OBS:ImageTemplates</command> attribute to a project.
   Any package container belonging to a project with that attribute will be
   shown on the template page.
  </para>
  <para>
   Only admins can add / remove the OBS:ImageTemplates attribute from a
   project.

  <title>Receiving image templates via interconnect</title>
  <para>
   If your OBS instance is connected to a remote instance via interconnect, OBS
   will fetch image templates from the remote instance and present it on the
   image templates page. They appear below the local templates.
  </para>
  <para>
   Have a look at the Managing build targets - Interconnect chapter of the OBS
   Administrator Guide to learn more about interconnects.
