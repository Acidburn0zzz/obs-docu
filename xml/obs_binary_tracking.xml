 <title>Binary Package Tracking</title>
 <para>
  Products and updates to them are often officially supported by a company.
  To allow giving such support, there is binary package tracking. This
  feature allows checking which exact version of a package was shipped at
  what time. This feature is often important for release managers,
  maintenance engineers, QA engineers and supporters.
 </para>
 <para>
  &obsa; can track these binary packages and offer a database to search
  them.
 </para>
 <sect1>
  <title>Which Binaries Are Tracked?</title>
  <para>
   All binaries which are released into projects providing
   <literal>kind=maintenance_release</literal> are tracked. In addition to
   that, the &obsa; administrator can configure additional projects via the
   <literal>packtrack</literal> setting in <filename>BSConfig.pm</filename>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>What Data Is Tracked?</title>
  <para> In short the information to identify a binary, its building place and
   timestamps are tracked. In addition to that also information about possible
   successor versions or if the binary got removed in the meantime. If products
   do reference the repositories the search interface offers also a listing of
   products which are supposed to use it. Either as part of the product media
   itself or in one of its update repositories. </para>
  <sect2>
   <title>Binary Identifier</title>
   <para>
    A binary is identified by the following information which is extracted from
    components of the file path of the binary:
