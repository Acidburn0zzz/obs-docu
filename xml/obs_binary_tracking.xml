 <title>Binary Package Tracking</title>
 <info/>
 <para> Official products and their updates are often claimed to be supported.
  Multiple parties, like release managers, maintenance engineers, QA and
  support need to be able to check which exact versions of a package got
  released. OBS server can track these binaries and offers a database to search
  them. </para>
 <sect1>
  <title>Which Binaries Are Tracked?</title>
  <para> All binaries which get released in to projects providing
   kind=maintenance_release get tracked. In addition to that the OBS
   administrator may configure addition projects via the packtrack setting in
   BSConfig.pm </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>What Data Is Tracked?</title>
  <para> In short the information to identify a binary, its building place and
   timestamps are tracked. In addition to that also information about possible
   successor versions or if the binary got removed in the meantime. If products
   do reference the repositories the search interface offers also a listing of
   products which are supposed to use it. Either as part of the product media
   itself or in one of its update repositories. </para>
  <sect2>
   <title>Binary Identifier</title>
   <para> A binary is identified by the following informationâ€”this is the
    components of the storage path and File Name of the binary:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para> repository: where is the binary hosted </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> name: the name of the binary file </para>

   <title>Binary Information</title>
   <para> Additional information about a binary is information which gets
    updated when a binary gets added or replaced. </para>

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> publish time, aka the time when the repository gets published by
      OBS. This is not the same time as when the release action got invoked.

  <para> The search is provided via the generic XPath search interface. It is
   provided below the paths:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para> /search/released/binary/id : short form, just listing the matched
     binary identifiers </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para> /search/released/binary : long form, provides all other tracked
     information as described above </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
