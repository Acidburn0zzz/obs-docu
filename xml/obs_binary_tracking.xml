 <title>Binary Package Tracking</title>
 <para>
  Official products and their updates are often claimed to be supported.
  Multiple parties, like release managers, maintenance engineers, QA and
  support need to be able to check which exact versions of a package got
  released. OBS server can track these binaries and offers a database to search
  them.
 </para>
 <section>
  <title>Which binaries get tracked?</title>
  <para>
   All binaries which get released in to projects providing
   kind=maintenance_release get tracked. In addition to that the OBS
   administrator may configure addition projects via the packtrack setting in
   BSConfig.pm
  </para>
 </section>
 <section>
  <title>What data is tracked?</title>
  <para>
   In short the information to identify a binary, its building place and
   timestamps are tracked. In addition to that also information about possible
   successor versions or if the binary got removed in the meantime. If products do
   reference the repositories the search interface offers also a listing of
   products which are supposed to use it. Either as part of the product media
   itself or in one of its update repositories.
  </para>
  <section>
