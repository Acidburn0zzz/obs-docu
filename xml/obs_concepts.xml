      <para>A project gets configured in the project <command>/source/$PROJECT/_meta</command> path. It can
            be edited in web interface in the <command>RAW Config</command> tab or via command line via

                 generic description data in <command>title</command> and <command>description</command> elements.

              <listitem><simpara>
                 An ACL list of users and groups connected with a role. The <command>maintainer</command>
                 role defines the list of users permitted to commit changes to the project.

              <listitem><simpara>
                 A number of flags, controlling the build and publishing process and possible read
                 access protections. 
              </simpara></listitem>
              <listitem><simpara>
                 A list of repositories to be created. This list defines what other repositories
                 should be used, which architectures shall be built and build job scheduling parameters.
              </simpara></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

      <para>The following flags can be used to control the behavior of a package or project. Most of them can
            also be limited to specified repositories or architectures.</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem><simpara>
            <command>build</command> flag defines if package sources should get build. If enabled, it signals the scheduler
            to trigger server side builds based on events like source changes, changes of packages used in
            the build environment or manual rebuild triggers. A local build via CLI is possible independent of 
            this flag.
            Default is enabled.
              </simpara></listitem>
           
              <listitem><simpara>
            <command>publish</command> can be used to enable or disable publishing the build result as repository. This happens
            after an entire repository has finished build for an architecture. A publish also gets triggered, when
            the publish flag is enabled after a repository finished the build.
            Default is enabled.
              </simpara></listitem>
           
              <listitem><simpara>
            <command>debuginfo</command> can be used to modify the build process to create debuginfo data along with the package
            build for later debugging purposes. A flag change is not triggering rebuilds, it just affects the next build.
            Default is disabled.
              </simpara></listitem>
           
              <listitem><simpara>
            <command>useforbuild</command> is used to control if a built result shall be copied to the build pool. This means it
            will get used for other builds in their buildenvironment. When this is disabled, the build has no
            influence on builds of other packages using this repository. In case a former build exists the old
            binaries will be used. Disabling this flag also means that "wipe" commands to remove binary files
            will have no effect on the build pool.
            A flag change is not triggering rebuilds, it just affects the next build.
            Default is enabled.
              </simpara></listitem>
           
              <listitem><simpara>
            <command>access</command> flag can be used to hide an entire project. This includes binaries
            and sources. It can only be used at project creation time and can just be
            enabled (making it public again) afterwards.
             This flag can only be used on projects.
            Default is enabled.
              </simpara></listitem>
           
              <listitem><simpara>
            <command>sourceaccess</command> flag can be used to hide the sources, but still show the existence of a
            project or package. This also includes debug packages in case the distribution is supporting this correctly.
              This flag can only be used at package creation time. There is no code
            yet which is checking for possible references to this package.
            Default is enabled.
              </simpara></listitem>
           
              <listitem><simpara>
            <command>downloadbinary</command> permission still exists like before. However, unlike "access"
            and "sourceaccess" this is not a security feature. It is just a convenience feature, which
            makes it impossible to get the binaries via the API directly. But it is still possible
            to get the binaries via build time in any case.
            Default is enabled.
              </simpara></listitem>
