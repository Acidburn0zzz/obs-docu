  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   Multibuild is used for sources that can build multiple packages. For that to
   be accomplished you must provide a file with a list of package names.
   For each of these listed packages a build instruction, e.g. a spec file, is
   needed. A set of package builds, repositories and architectures will be built
   for each package.
  </para>
  <para>
   For example, with the <command>kernel</command> package we can build both
   <command>kernel-source</command> and <command>kernel-obs-build</command>
   packages.

  <title>How Multibuild is Defined</title>
  <para>
   Multibuild packages are defined with the <command>_multibuild</command>
   directive file in the package sources.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <command>_multibuild</command> file is an xml file. For example:
<screen><command>&lt;multibuild&gt;
  &lt;package&gt;gcc-package1&lt;/package&gt;
  &lt;package&gt;gcc-package2&lt;/package&gt;
&lt;/multibuild&gt;
</command></screen>
