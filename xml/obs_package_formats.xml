 <title>Package Formats</title>
 <info/>
 <para> OBS differentiates between the format of the build recipes and the
  format of the installed packages. For example, the <literal>spec</literal>
  recipe format is used to build rpm packages by calling
   <command>rpmbuild</command>. In most cases the build result format is the
  same as the package format used for setting up the build environment, but
  sometimes the format is different. An example is the <literal>kiwi</literal>
  recipe format, which builds products and isos, but uses rpm packages to setup
  the build process. </para>
 <para> OBS currently supports <literal>rpm</literal>, <literal>deb</literal>
  (Debian), <literal>arch</literal> as package formats and
   <literal>spec</literal>, <literal>dsc</literal>, <literal>kiwi</literal>
  (both product and appliances), <literal>arch</literal>,
   <literal>preinstallimage</literal> and <literal>simpleimage</literal> as
  recipe formats. </para>
 <sect1>
  <title>Setting up a format</title>
  <para> If no recipe format and binary format is specified in the prjconf, OBS
   tries to deduce them from the preinstall list, which includes the name of
   the used package manager. This means that you need to manually configure the
    <literal>kiwi</literal> recipe config, as an rpm package format will select
    <literal>spec</literal> builds as default. This configuration is done by
   adding a <literal>Type</literal> line to the project configuration. </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Recipe Specials</title>
  <para> Each format has some specials </para>
  <sect2>
   <title>spec</title>
   <para> For building rpms you need a .spec file for each package, containing
    its build description. OBS parses the spec file's BuildRequires lines to
    get a list of package dependencies. OBS uses this information to both build
    the packages in the correct order and also for setting up the build
    environment. The parser understands most of rpm's macro handling, so it is
    possible to use architecture specific BuildRequires, conditional builds and
    other advanced rpm features. </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <title>deb</title>
   <para> To build *.deb files, which are used on Debian-based distributions,
    you need the following files: </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para> debian.control </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist> 
   <para>Here is the meta information for the package like the build
    dependencies or some description. </para>
   <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para> debian.rules </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist> 
   <para>This file describes the build section of the deb building
    process. There are the configure and make compile commands including other
    deb building sections. </para>
   <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para> $PACKAGE.dsc </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist> 
   <para>In this file you describe the package names of each
    subpackage and their dependency level. Unlike rpm, the release numbers are
    not increased automatically during build unless the keyword
    DEBTRANSFORM-RELEASE is added to the file. </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <title>pkg</title>
   <para> This package format is for Arch Linux and its derivatives. To build
    an Arch Linux pkg you need a PKGBUILD file containing the build description
    and the source tarball. PKGBUILD's have no macros like %{buildroot}. They
    have variables for example
      <literal>makedepends=(<replaceable>PACKAGE1</replaceable>,
      <replaceable>PACKAGE2</replaceable>)</literal>. This variables are parsed
    by the OBS and uses them as dependencies. On Arch Linux you typically build
    packages without subpackage. They are no *-dev or *-devel packages. </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="_kiwi_appliance">
   <title>kiwi appliance</title>
   <para>
    <link xlink:href="http://opensuse.github.io/kiwi/">KIWI</link> is an image
    producing platform that builds images for various formats, starting from
    hardware images, virtualization systems like QEMU, Xen and VMware and many
    more. It supports a wide range of architectures, which are x86, x86_64,
    s390 and ppc. </para>
   <para> Build instructions for KIWI usually consists of: </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <command>my_image.kiwi</command> contains the image configuration in xml
       format. Full XML schema documentation can be found <link
        xlink:href="https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/schema-doc/"
        >here</link>. </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <command>config.sh (optional)</command> configuration script that runs
       at the end of the installation, but before package scripts have run.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <command>root/</command> directory that contains files that will be
       applied to the built image after package installation. This can also be
       an archived and compressed directory. </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   <note>
    <para> OBS only accepts files with a <filename class="extension"
      >.kiwi</filename> suffix as a KIWI configuration file. Other naming
     schemes KIWI supports, like the <filename>config.xml</filename>, are
     getting ignored in OBS. </para>

   <title>simpleimage</title>
   <para> This format can be used to get simple rootfs tarball or squashfs
    image. It does not contain bootloader nor kernel. For advanced features,
    use KIWI. Use simpleimage for simple rootfs tarball/squashfs image of any
    distribution that is supported by OBS but does not have anything fancier
    than that. </para>
   <para> Simple image uses similar syntax as spec file. Supported tags include
    Name, Version and BuildRequires which is the way how to specify list of
    packages to include. #!BuildIgnore can be also used. For additional
    customization %build phase is supported - run via bash. RPM macros are not
    supported, but $SRCDIR shell variable is available. </para>
