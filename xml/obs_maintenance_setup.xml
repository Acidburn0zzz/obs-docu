  <title>The Maintenance Setup</title>
  <para>This chapter explains the setup and workflow of doing maintenance the openSUSE way. 
        However, this should not be limited to openSUSE distribution projects but be usable (including
        all steps or in parts).
        </para>

  <para>The goal of the OBS maintenance process is to publish updates for a frozen project, in
        this example an entire distribution. These updates needs be approved by a maintenance 
        team and the published result must contain documentation about the changes and be appliable
        in the most easy way by the users. </para>

    <para>This figure is giving a basic overview about the project setup and general workflow for a single
          package and single maintained distribution. It shows the "openSUSE:11.4" project, which is considered to be frozen and not changing
          at all anymore. The "openSUSE:11.4:Update" projects hosts all officially released updates. It does not build
          any binary, just gets it sources and binaries from the maintenance incident project via the release process. The
          incident project is named "openSUSE:Maintenance:IDxxx" in this example, which is under control of the maintenance team.
          Official updates get built and reviewed here. QA is also
          testing the binaries from here. However, a user can prepare it in the same way in his project and start the 
          maintenance process via doing a "maintenance" request.</para>

  <section>
    <title>How to use the maintenance process</title>
    <para>This describes all required steps by all involved persons from preparing to releasing a maintenance update.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Way A: Process gets initiated by the maintainer</title>
      <para>A user is usally starting to prepare an update by creating a maintenance branch. This is typically done via
            creating an own maintenance project (in this example for glibc including checkout) via</para>
      <screen><command>osc mbranch -c glibc</command></screen>
      <para>This is equivalent to the api call <command>/source?cmd=branch&amp;package=glibc</command>.</para>
      <para>The user needs to do the needed modifications now. Packages will be built and can be tested. Afterwards he
            need to add informations about the purpose of this maintenance update via</para>
      <screen><command>osc patchinfo</command></screen>
      <para>The server will create a full maintenance channel now, in case the user wants to test this as well. Otherwise
            he can create a maintenance request:</para>
      <screen><command>osc maintenancerequest</command></screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Way B: Process gets initiated by the maintenance team</title>
      <para>The maintenance team may start the process (for example because a security became reported and the
            maintenance team decided that a fix is required). In this case the incident gets created via the webui or via
            the api call</para>
      <para><command>/source?cmd=createmaintenanceincident?attribute=OBS:Maintenance</command>.</para>
      <para>... FIXME: how to request work from developer ? </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Maintenance team takes over</title>
      <para>The maintenance request is targeted against the defined maintenance project, in our example this is openSUSE:Maintenance. 
            The defined maintainer and reviewers in this project need to decide about this request. In case it gets
            accepted, the server is creating a subproject with a unique ID and copies the sources and build settings to it.
            The origin project will get removed by default. This maintenace project is used to build the final packages. The
            maintenance team may still modify them or the patchinfo data at this point. When the maintenance people are okay
            with the update, they can create a request to release the sources and binaries to the final openSUSE:11.4:Update
            project.</para>
      <screen><command>osc releaserequest</command></screen>
      <para>The release will create a unique release ID which will become part of the updateinfo.xml file in the target project.
            This ID is different from the incident ID and is usually in the style of "YEAR-COUNTER". A different nameing scheme
            can be defined via the OBS:MaintenanceIdTemplate attribute value. The release will move all packages to the update
            project and extend the target package name with the incident ID. Binaries will be moved as well without modification.
            The exception is the updateinfo.xml which will get updates its id with the release id instead of the incident id.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Update gets released</title>
      <para>The release request needs typically be approved by QA and other teams as defined in the Update project. In case 
            something gets rejected, the needed changes need to be submitted to the maintenance project and a new release request
            has to be created.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Defining a maintenance space</title>
      <para>An OBS server is using by default a maintenance space defined via the OBS:Maintenance attribute. This must get created
            on a project where maintenance incident projects should get created below. This project is also defining the default
            maintenance maintainers and reviewers in it's acl list.</para>
      <para>It is possible to have multiple and independend maintenance name spaces, however the maintenance request must be created
            against this other namespace manually or using a different attribute. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Maintained Project Setups</title>
      <para>Maintained projects must be frozen, this means no changes in sources or binaries. All updates will be hosted in defined
            update project. This project gets defined via the OBS:UpdateProject attribute which must contain a value with the
            update project name. In addition to this also an attribute to define the active maintenance should be defined, by default
            the OBS:Maintained attribute. The osc mbranch command will take packages from this project as a result. </para>
      <para>The Update project should be defined as build disabled as well. Define also a project link to the main project and at least 
            one repository building against the main project.</para>
