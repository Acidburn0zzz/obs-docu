   <title>Product Line Setup</title>
   <para>
    Bigger products, like openSUSE or SUSE Linux Enterprise usually contain
    multiple media. These media must be kept in sync in various ways, for
    example for installation patterns, version numbering and other meta
    data. To guarantee this, OBS provides the product definition xml.
    Submitting such a product xml will create all necessary sources for meta
    packages and also all needed kiwi source files.
